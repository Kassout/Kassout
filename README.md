### Hello you who fall there!

As you may have guessed, my name is Maxime (or for people who know me on the internet, Kassout). 
I am a fullstack developer working in the web development field. 
With a passion for programming I give a lot of my free time to what I consider as a hobby of learning, 
about tech specific subjects, tech news, or ofc not-obviously tech things like science, art, etc.

My love for games made me start a game programming learning path in the end of 2020, 
in the hope of make it out to the field as a next career opportunity.

If you're looking for me, it is therefore very likely that you will find me working with the Unity game engine, 
either for game jams or bigger game prototypes. As a physics/mathematics former engineer student, 
game dev feels and seems like one way to evolve my default curiosity for those two fields, 
expending and applying them to the things I love the most spending my time when I'm not programming: Playing video games.

Please feel free to reach me for any professional opportunity you think I may be interested and look around my work repositories.

Hope to see you soon!
