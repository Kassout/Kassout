### Hello you who fall there!

As you may have guessed, my name is Maxime (or for people who know me on the internet, Kassout). 
I am a former full stack developer who had work in the web programming field for about 3 years. 
With a passion for programming, I give a lot of my free time to what I consider as a hobby of learning, 
about tech specific subjects, tech news, or of course not-obviously tech things like science, art, etc.

My love for games made me start a game programming learning path in the end of 2020. This journey successfully leads me to occupy junior gameplay and tools programmer positions in different studios, working on games I can't say a word about. You know, NDA things :D

If you're looking for me, it is therefore very likely that you will find me working with the Unity game engine, 
either for game jams, tools, or bigger game prototypes. As a physics/mathematics former engineer student, 
game dev feels and seems like one way to evolve my default curiosity for those two fields, 
expending and applying them to the things I love the most spending my time on when I'm not programming: Playing video games.

Please feel free to reach me for any professional opportunity you think I may be interested, and look around my work repositories.

Hope to see you soon!
